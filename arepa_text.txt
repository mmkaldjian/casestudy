    Order Curbside Pickup

    Hola Arepa is a restaurant in South Minneapolis serving our take on Latin street food.  We serve Venezuelan-style stuffed arepas, Latin American-influenced small plates, and tropical craft cocktails.

    Chef Christina Nguyen & her partner Birk Grudem started Hola Arepa as a food truck in 2011. Though the truck has been mostly in hibernation since they opened their brick & mortar restaurant in 2014, you can always enjoy their arepas, other dishes & cocktails in a space inspired by their travels to beach towns and charming old cafes in South America, Central America and Mexico.

    All of our food is made from scratch with love. Arepas are made fresh every day from cornmeal dough and pattied by hand.

    Arepas are cooked on a griddle until golden brown, then split open and stuffed with meats, veggies, cheeses, and homemade salsas. Arepas & most of our dishes are gluten-free.
