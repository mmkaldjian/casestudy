# Hola Arepa Design System Study

## About

This is a project for Web Development I at  Minneapolis College of Art and Deisgn (MCAD). In this example, I have dissected the [Hola Arepa homepage](https://www.holaarepa.com/), developed a  component library, and finally, re-created their home page based upon this study.
