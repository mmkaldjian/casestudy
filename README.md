# Hola Arepa Design System Study

## About

This is a project for Web Development I at  Minneapolis College of Art and Deisgn (MCAD). In this example, I have dissected the [Hola Arepa homepage](https://www.holaarepa.com/), developed a  component library, and finally, re-created their home page based upon this study.

- [Initial Design Study](https://github.com/mmkaldjian/casestudy/blob/main/assets/component_study.pdf)
- [Component Library](https://mmkaldjian.github.io/casestudy/components/) Note - this library pulls from a separate .css file, in order to have all elements display themselves in a visually fluent manner, ie. some text is gray when it is white in the final version, some margins are different than in final version. When this happens, it is noted in the .css file.
