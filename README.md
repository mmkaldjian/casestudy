# Hola Arepa Design System Study

## About

This is a project for Web Development I at  Minneapolis College of Art and Deisgn (MCAD). In this example, I have dissected the [Hola Arepa homepage](https://www.holaarepa.com/), developed a  component library, and finally, re-created their home page based upon this study.

- [Initial Design Study](https://github.com/mmkaldjian/casestudy/blob/main/assets/component_study.pdf)
- [Component Library](https://mmkaldjian.github.io/casestudy/components/) Note - this library pulls from a separate .css file, in order to have all elements display themselves in a visually fluent manner, ie. some text is gray when should beb white, some margins are different than in final page. When this happens, it is marked in the .css file as a note.
